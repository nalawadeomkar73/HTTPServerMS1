Which features did you implement? 
  Entire assignment

Did you complete any extra-credit tasks? If so, which ones?
  Yes. Event-driven  programming

Any special instructions for building and running your solution?
  For event driven implementation, I have declared a boolean useEventDrvien in the
  HTTPServer class which has to be set to to true. This will run the event driven implementation
  and when useEventDriven is false it will run the normal HTTPServer implementation.

  [x] Yes
  [ ] No

  [ ] Yes
  [x] No
