Which features did you implement? 
  Entire assignment

Did you complete any extra-credit tasks? If so, which ones?
  Yes. Event-driven  programming

Any special instructions for building and running your solution?
  For event driven implementation, I have declared a boolean useEventDrvien in the
  HTTPServer class which has to be set to true. This will run the event driven implementation
  and when useEventDriven is false it will run the normal HTTPServer implementation.
  Also it works perfectly from the browser but in telnet while entering the request it has to be
  entered as one complete request.

(other than code from the course web page)?
  [x] Yes
  [ ] No

Did you copy any code from the Internet, or from classmates?
